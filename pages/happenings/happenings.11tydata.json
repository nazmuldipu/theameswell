        "The Lodging Conference has been extremely popular for 25 years, and with good reason. It’s where some of the industry’s most influential leaders join to strategize about development, finance, franchising, management, construction, design, and operations. The event prides itself on being “more than just a conference,” but rather “a think tank where everybody in attendance has the opportunity to join in the conversation, discuss issues, and solve problems.”",
        "Reservations are recommended and seating is limited."
