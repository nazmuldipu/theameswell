What was so fascinating about these paintings was their subjects inconsistency with the seasons - flowers that are unable to bloom at the same time as one another, “a botanical impossibility” speaks Sooke (Telegraph, 2016). The artists had in fact constructed the paintings from years of individual studies, in order to create the most extravagant, elegant assortment. Meeuws’ work mimics this layering technique in a contemporary fashion by capturing each flower on his camera then digitally arranging them, refining every detail until perfection is reached.",

In his Azimuth series, images from the Hubble telescope are printed as negatives, then rendered with an almost alchemical cyanotype technique: exposed over canvas by sun, moon and star light. The result is explosive photographic possibilities of the universe: red iron is changed into blue, stark binaries crumble, photography meets painting, science converges with art, and ultimately, opposing world-views synthesize.",
